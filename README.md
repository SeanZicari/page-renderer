Simple Page Renderer
====================

Uses a simple [Pure CSS][pure] layout compiled from the [pure-site][] project.

There are some CSS issues with the templates, but hopefully it is clear when pages are switched.

I set up the pages as follows:

Page 1 -> header1, footer1

Page 2 -> header1, body1, footer1

Page 3 -> header1, body2, footer2

Page 4 -> header2, body3, advertisement1, footer1
